This is an interactive to-do list where you can shoot your to-do items when you finish them. Currently, the items are hard-coded (hopefully it matches your personal to-do list). This project was developed in xcode, and will be most easily run by using the xcode project file. Simply open up the .xcodeproj file and hit the play > button in the top left corner!

Controls:

Mouse = After switching to play mode, move the mouse around to look around. Left button shoots. Mouse wheel zooms.
P/p = play/pause (start out paused--note that your mouse will be captured/uncaptured when you hit P)
Q/q = quit
S/s = take screenshot (it will be saved in the build/debug folder)

Happy hunting!
